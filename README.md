## Description:
This is a ray-marched (discount) edition of my robotic character, Pumpkin. He is a robot, made for riding and hunting, with an empathetic heart. He likes bight colors, sunlight, butterflies and making his owner happy. He also likes hugs, but he has no arms, so they make him sad. Be nice to him!
